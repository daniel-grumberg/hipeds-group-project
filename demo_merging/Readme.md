# Matlab demo for reading, denoising, merging and exporting (to .ply) point clouds. Code was developed for the purposes of HiPEDS Group Project 2018, Imperial College of London.

Run ```demo_merge.m``` script.

TODO: Needs parametrization.

Input plys are stored in ```input_data``` folder while the produced one is exported to ```output_data``` folder.

# Capabilities:

  - Import ply files as point cloud objects
  - Denoise them
  - Merge with ICP algorithm
  - Calculate the enclosed volume using polynomial fitting and double integration
